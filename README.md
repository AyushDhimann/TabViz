## TABVIZ

tabviz is a pip library, which integrates with tableau, and uses AI to create interactive visualizations right in your jupyter notebook. it is as easy as just pip installing , setting the varibales, and then just providing the dataset and it visualizes right in the jupyter notebook cell.



Developers problems:

Usually data scuentis and data analysts have to use pandas or other data visualization tools, and most of the times, have to manually create data visualizatons for them to help understand the dataset, which takes a lot of cruical time, given a work load.




TABVIZ

here comes tabviz, 
	uses the power of tableau, with interactions, and more data visualizations
	which uses the power of AI(Google Gemini API[free]), to automatically create meaningful visualizations of data right into tableau.
	makes the process easy, it's just a 3 step process to visualize



Demo: 

( Here comes the demo part )



Use Cases

yk how easy it becomes for data analysitics to work and shar their data to others with the help of tabviz
projects can use this into their projects to make the process of getting source data, and visualzing it way easier, very very easy for them. it also has a large scope if givena actual support from developers around the world



To-Do's

We are actively working on these features to make tabviz even more better as for now it is just a proof of concept and it would require some time to make it really useful for evryone

	custom prompting to just prompt and get a new data visualization
	Overwriting the same workbook as it creates a new workbook everytime the data source is changed(because tabviz is a proof of concept)
	more smart visualiations options

Final words



so this was all about tabviz. i am looking forward to win this hackathon and getting support from other developers to make this project a reality.
